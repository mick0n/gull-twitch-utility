## Index-page
Used on stream to show notifications and chat messages.

## Util-page
This page is meant to be used on a secondary screen, preferably a tablet or mobile phone.
It will display all events in a descending list to easily see what's going on in your stream.
If on a touch input device, you can enable input controls for showing/hiding a certain type of events.
If you are using OBS you can also enable the simple OBS tools to further enhance your streaming experience.
